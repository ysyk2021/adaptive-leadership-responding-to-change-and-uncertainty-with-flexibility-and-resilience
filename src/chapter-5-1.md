By fostering a culture that embraces change and values learning, leaders create a resilient and adaptable organization.

### 1.2 Encourage Innovation and Experimentation

Leaders encourage innovation and experimentation within their teams. They create spaces where new ideas are welcomed, and failures are seen as learning opportunities. By encouraging creative thinking and providing the necessary resources and support, leaders promote a culture of innovation that thrives even amidst uncertainty.

2. Foster Open Communication

They provide regular updates, share information about organizational changes, and address concerns and questions openly. By being authentic and honest in their communication, leaders build trust and maintain clarity amidst ambiguity.

### 2.2 Actively Listen and Engage

Leaders actively listen to their team members' perspectives and concerns. They create opportunities for dialogue and encourage individuals to voice their ideas and opinions. By engaging in active listening and valuing diverse viewpoints, leaders gain insights, foster collaboration, and make more informed decisions.
